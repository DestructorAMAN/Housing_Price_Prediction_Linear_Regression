# Housing_Price_Prediction_Linear_Regression
The data contains the selling prices of different houses based on different characteristics like area, no. of rooms,, no. of Bathrooms, etc..
This project aims to predict housing prices based on various features using the Linear Regression algorithm. It is implemented in Python and utilizes popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Housing Prices" dataset, which contains information about different houses such as the number of bedrooms, total square footage, location, etc., along with their corresponding sale prices. The dataset is provided in the file `Raw_Housing_Prices.csv`.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/DestructorAMAN/Housing_Price_Prediction_Linear_Regression.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd housing-pricing-linear-regression

3. Run the `main.py` script:

python main.py
This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the linear regression model, and provide predictions for the housing prices.

4. You can modify the parameters in the `main.py` script to experiment with different configurations, such as feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, etc.

## Results

After running the `main.py` script, the model's performance metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared value, will be displayed in the console. Additionally, the predictions for housing prices will be saved in the file `predictions.csv`.
